# 👋 Hi, I’m **Praveen Kumar** — AI Leader • Architect • Hands-On Builder

I bridge the gap between **strategy and delivery**, driving AI initiatives from whiteboard concepts to production-grade systems that serve millions. With **12+ years** in data science and a current role as **Senior Manager, AI & Data Science at Jio Platforms**, I lead teams, shape enterprise AI roadmaps, and still enjoy cracking open a notebook to prototype the next idea.
